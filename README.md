## 1. Introduction

This document is for engineers who are developing GENSAT-1 custom Applications for EPS, ADCS, GadMag, Agile, etc. Before diving into the code, make sure understand the IOs of your payload, CCSDS package, and the basic knowledge of the cFS. This document is focusing on the app itself. If you are unsure about how to build an embedded Linux image for the dev board (Xilinx Zedboard) using Petalinux, or how to build the cFS executable that is compatible with the dev board environment, please go to the Development Board tab under Wiki on Teams.
